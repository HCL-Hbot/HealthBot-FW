## Healbot FW - SANDBOX
Welcome to Healbot FW - a modular Embedded Firmware creation repository for the Social Robotics project.

### Overview
This repository serves as a sandbox for the development of Healbot FW, aimed at eventual transformation into a library. Currently, it contains a collection of code modules crafted by the S6 2324-group. Due to time constraints in development capacity and concerns regarding maintainability, this repository is designated as a sandbox environment.

### Code Quality
It's important to note that the current codebase is a work in progress and may not yet meet optimal standards. Developed at Technical Readiness Level 3, the project aimed to explore various proof of concepts while ensuring core functionality in a multi-disciplined and scrum-based environment. While industry best practices and standards are applied by the experienced developers involved, they may not be consistently implemented throughout the codebase.
